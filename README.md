# Anperi (Projekt-SS18)
## how to build C# project:
* build only possible on windows
* only on english or german versions (build events might break for others)
* only tested in VS2017
* required target frameworks: .net framework 4.6.2, .net core 2.0

*This might not be needed anymore thanks to [this commit](https://github.com/Bobocato/Projekt-SS18/commit/4d9b1811ccae0501cb833d1fb1b2480c0ac1a5ee):*
after first build try, add folder nugetOut as nuget repo (/src/cs/nugetOut/), then build again
